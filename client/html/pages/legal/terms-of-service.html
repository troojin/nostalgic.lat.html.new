                The accounts, activities, items, games and models are for you to
                play with while on the site. Except as permitted by the
                functionality of this site, you can't sell them (for money or
                Valkyrie Points), give them to anyone, trade them for anything
                (including Valkyrie Points), or pretend you made them. You can
                display our pictures on your own personal web pages for your
                personal noncommercial use ONLY as long as you write either
                "Copyright [Current Year] Valkyrie Corporation All Rights

                either on web pages that contain our pictures and other

                Most models, games and content on the message boards come
                straight from other Valkyrie users, not from someone at
                Valkyrie. If you see anything mean or nasty on the site, or
                anyone sends you anything that makes you uncomfortable or asks
                for your password or personal information (such as your name,
                address or phone number), please let us know immediately at
                <a href="mailto:support@valk.fun">support@valk.fun</a> so that
                we can handle it right away! However, reporting false abuse or
                inappropriate feedback will not be tolerated and will likely
                result in a frozen account.

                If you create a game, author a model, or write something that
                catches our eye on a message board, we might want to use it on
                the site or elsewhere when talking about the site. If you're
                under age 18, remember to ALWAYS check with your parents before
                you send anything to us or post anything on the site! By sending
                in your content and comments, you (and your parents) are
                agreeing that it's okay to repeat on the site and elsewhere what
                you say, and it's even all right for us to use it in an ad. So,
                this means we can use it in any way we want, anywhere, until the
                end of time.
